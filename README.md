# Developer Bible

The Developer Bible is a place where all IT wisdom is stored. The Bible allows knowledge to be shared and used by others.

Each folder contains notes that explain the most important topics of a given technology/library/framework in an understandable way.

_If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough._ - Albert Einstein

Most important information about the notes: 
- Each note should be as easy to understand as possible even for a person who hasn't dealt with a given topic before. You should think about it as explaining things to 3 year old child. 
- Each note should cover one topic. 
- Each note header should also be in the table of contents in alphabetical order.
