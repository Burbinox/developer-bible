# Developer Bible

The Developer Bible serves as my personal collection of notes. Most of what Iâ€™ve learned is written down here. It allows knowledge to be shared and reused by others. If you find a mistake or see room for improvement, feel free to create a pull request with your changes.

Each folder contains notes that explain the most important topics of a given technology, library, or framework in a clear and understandable way.

_If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough._ - Albert Einstein

## Create pull request
To create a pull request you need to first fork the original repository, then punt your changes to the forked repository, and then create a pull request between the base repository main branch and the forked repository. 

Notes rules:
- Each note should be as easy to understand as possible even for a person who hasn't dealt with a given topic before. You should think about it as explaining things to 3 year old child. 
- Each note should cover one topic. 
- Each note header should also be in the table of contents in alphabetical order.
