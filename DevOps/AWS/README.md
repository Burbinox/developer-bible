# AWS

## Regions i Availability Zones
Completely separate physical servers/data centers. Served to ensure the lowest possible latency and high availability to the users. Most AWS services are Region-scope.

## IAM
IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that allows you to manage users, groups, roles and access permissions to AWS services and resources. IAM is intended for use within an organization.

## IAM Policies
Real permissions in JSON format that we can grant to users or groups.

## IAM Roles
Permissions granted to AWS services, e.g. EC2, Lambda.

## EC2 User Data
EC2 User Data is a feature that allows you to pass scripts to an EC2 instance during its launch. When an EC2 instance is launched with user data, it is executed as soon as the instance starts up. 

## Security Groups
They control the traffic so what is allowed to go in or out of EC2 Instances.
