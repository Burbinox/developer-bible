## BigQuerry <a name="bigquerry"></a>
BigQuery is a serverless data warehouse - a system designed for storing data in an organized format, mainly in the form of tables. It allows users to execute queries using SQL and is built to handle very large volumes of data, reaching even petabytes. The pricing model is based either on the amount of data processed (on-demand) or can be structured as a monthly subscription (flat-rate).

## Dataflow <a name="dataflow"></a>
Dataflow - serverless ETL/ELT service that uses Apache Beam as the engine for building pipelines. 

## Dataproc <a name="dataproc"></a>
Dataproc - managed service for running Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Hive clusters, commonly used to build and run ETL/ELT pipelines. Unlike Dataflow, with Dataproc you are responsible for managing the clusters, including provisioning, scaling, and maintenance.
