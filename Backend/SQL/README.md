## Difference between DELETE, DROP and TRUNCATE <a name="difference_between_delete_drop_and_truncate"></a>
- DELETE deletes a record from table 
- DROP deletes whole table 
- TRUNCATE deletes all records in table

## Index in database <a name="index_in_database"></a>
Index in a database creates a data structure that speeds up the reading process but slows down the write/update/delete process because the index data structure needs to be updated to reflect the changes made.
