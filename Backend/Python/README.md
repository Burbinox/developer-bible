# Python

## List of comprehension
``` python
[expression for item in list]
```
or
``` python
[expression for item in list if expression else expression]
```

## Dict of comprehension
``` python
{key: value for vars in iterable} e.g. {num: num*num for num in range (1,11)}
```

## Context Managers
Context manager is an object that defines the behavior that should be performed before and after a block of code is executed. You use the context manager with the `with` keyword. To make your own context manager you create a class in it you define the methods `__entry__` and `__exit__` these are the methods that will be executed before and after executing the code located in the `with` block.

## Iterators
Iterators in Python are just objects that you can iterate at. The iterator remembers its current state. To create you own Iterator you need a class with two magic methods:
- `__iter__()` which returns the iterator object itself and it is used to initialize the iterator.
- `__next__()` which returns the next item from the iterator. It raises the `StopIteration` exception when there are no more items left to return.

Iterators are used to loop through a large amount of data because they remember only teh current state and the next item so it is memory-optimized. The downside of it is that you don't have access to previous or after elements.

## Generators
Generator is a basicaly an Iterator but is much easier to create. 
``` python 
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
```
or you can use Generator Comprehension:
``` python 
(i for i in range(100))
```
