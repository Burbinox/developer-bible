- [Moments](#moments)
- [Percentile](#percentile)

## Moments <a name="moments"></a>
- first moment - mean
- second moment - variance
- third moment - skew -  measures the asymmetry of a probability distribution, indicating whether data tails off more to the left (negative skew) or right (positive skew)
- forth moment - kurtosis - how thick is the tail, and how sharp is the peak. Higher peaks have higher kurtosis

## Percentile <a name="percentile"></a>
Percentiles indicate how a particular value compares to the rest of a dataset by showing the percentage of values below it. For instance, being in the 75th percentile means your result is higher than 75% of all other results.
