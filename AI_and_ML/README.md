## Linear Regression <a name="linear_regression"></a> 
Fits a straight line to a data set of observations, it can be used to predict new values.

## Moments <a name="moments"></a>
- first moment - mean
- second moment - variance
- third moment - skew -  measures the asymmetry of a probability distribution, indicating whether data tails off more to the left (negative skew) or right (positive skew)
- forth moment - kurtosis - how thick is the tail, and how sharp is the peak. Higher peaks have higher kurtosis

## Percentile <a name="percentile"></a>
Percentiles indicate how a particular value compares to the rest of a dataset by showing the percentage of values below it. For instance, being in the 75th percentile means your result is higher than 75% of all other results.

## R-squared <a name="r-squared"></a>
Is a statistical measure that indicates how well the regression line fits the data. It is commonly used in linear regression to assess the quality of the model. (range 0-1, 0 bad, 1 good)
